# Now take a look on the dataset that has been provided 
In the module 2 chapter 2, you have learned alread about the 4 phase design step, so now it is time for you to apply all your skill here:
1. Conceptual 
  - Think about how many entities (tables) should you have in this model.
  - Raise all of them by drawing it 
  - 
2. Logical 
  - Decide what are the attributes that will be put in each table.
  - Decide how these entities and relationships map to tables.
3. Nomalization
  - We will skip this as we haven't learned yet. Will get back in chapter 3
4. Physical 
  - Now it time for you to apply the constrain in each table (Null, Primary Key, Foriegn Key, etc.)
  - Also specify the data type in each attribute as well
